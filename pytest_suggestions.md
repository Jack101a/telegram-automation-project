Pytest Testing Strategy
Here is a suggested strategy for testing the various components of the automation bot using pytest and pytest-asyncio.
1. Database Tests (tests/test_db.py)
Goal: Ensure database operations (CRUD, encryption) work correctly in isolation.
Setup:
 * Use an in-memory SQLite database for tests to avoid creating files and ensure isolation (sqlalchemy.create_engine("sqlite:///:memory:")).
 * Create a fixture to initialize the schema for each test function.
Test Cases:
 * test_add_and_get_user: Verify that a user can be added and that their retrieved serial_no is correctly decrypted.
 * test_update_user: Ensure user details can be updated.
 * test_encryption_cycle: Directly test the _encrypt and _decrypt functions to ensure data integrity.
 * test_create_session_and_update_state: Check that a session is created with the correct initial state and can be updated.
 * test_log_event: Verify that logs are correctly associated with a session.
 * test_add_artifact: Check that artifacts are correctly recorded.
2. Bot Handler Tests (tests/test_bot.py)
Goal: Test the bot's conversation flows (FSM) without needing a real Telegram connection.
Setup:
 * Use aiogram.fsm.storage.memory.MemoryStorage to manage state during tests.
 * Mock the db.py module using unittest.mock.patch to prevent actual database calls. You can make mocked functions return predefined data.
 * Use pytest-asyncio.
Test Cases:
 * test_start_command_new_user: Simulate a new user sending /start. Check that the bot replies correctly and enters the getting_serial_no state.
 * test_start_command_existing_user: Mock get_user_data to return an existing user. Verify the "Welcome back" message is sent.
 * test_registration_flow: Simulate a full registration conversation: /start -> provide serial -> provide valid DOB. Check that add_or_update_user is called with the correct data.
 * test_invalid_dob_format: Send a badly formatted date and check for the error message and that the state remains getting_dob.
 * test_submit_unregistered_user: Mock get_user_data to return None. Check for the "please register" message.
 * test_submit_registered_user: Mock get_user_data to return a user. Verify that create_session is called and the user receives the session ID.
3. Orchestrator and Automation Tests (tests/test_orchestrator.py)
Goal: Test the orchestration logic by mocking the expensive parts (Playwright automation).
Setup:
 * Mock the entire automation.py module. Create a mock execute_automation_step function that can be configured to return different result dictionaries for each call, simulating a real browser session.
 * Mock the aiogram.Bot instance to capture calls to send_message, send_photo, etc., and assert they were called with the correct arguments.
 * Use a real in-memory DB to test state transitions.
Test Cases:
 * test_successful_session_lifecycle:
   * Create a QUEUED session in the test DB.
   * Run the orchestrate_session function.
   * Mock execute_automation_step to first return {"status": "PAUSE_AWAITING_CAPTCHA", ...}.
   * Verify the bot was asked to send a photo and set the FSM state.
   * Manually put a response into the USER_INPUT_QUEUES.
   * Mock execute_automation_step to then return {"status": "SUCCESS", ...}.
   * Verify the session state in the DB is COMPLETED and the user received a success message.
 * test_session_failure_on_bad_captcha: Simulate a CAPTCHA failure from the automation module and check that the DB state is FAILED.
 * test_session_timeout: Don't put anything in the input queue and verify that the session times out, the DB state is FAILED, and the user is notified.
